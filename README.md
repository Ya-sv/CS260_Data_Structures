# Data-Structures
describtion: this courses Explores stacks, queues, lists, vectors, hash tables, graphs, trees and algorithms including sorting, searching, iterating over data structures and recursion. 

Outcome Assessment Strategies:
Students will demonstrate competency on exam(s) or labs which are constructed to demonstrate:

An understanding of the basic data structures.
An understanding of the basic search and sort algorithms.
The appropriate use of a particular data structure and algorithm to solve a problem.
The ability to estimate big-O timings.
